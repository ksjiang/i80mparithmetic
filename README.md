# Intel 8085 MultiPrecision Arithmetic
Collection of i8085 functions to add, subtract, multiply, and divide multiprecision numbers stored in memory

The Intel 8080 and 8085 are 8-bit microprocessors with instruction sets that operate primarily on 8-bit register and memory data. Furthermore, its instruction set lacks multiplication and division operations. These arithmetic operations are essential for many tasks the processor may encounter. This small library includes functions that may be called from another procedure and will return results in memory. The documentation below describes what registers will be affected, how arguments are to be submitted to the function, and how the function will return results.
